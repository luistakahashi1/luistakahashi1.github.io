      <h4>Summary</h4>
      <p>
        Luis studied Law at the University of Sao Paulo. Soon he realized he would never want to be a lawyer so he joined the Brazilian Federal Police right after college.
        At the Federal Police he worked in various functions and geographies: a year in the Amazon (the jungle, not the e-commerce company) combating drug trafficking; about three years investigating debit card and Internet banking fraud in Sao Paulo; and for a couple other years managing crises in the Sao Paulo metro area, among others.
        Having had a brief experience starting his own business on the side, he decided to apply for an MBA. He now studies at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and intends to live in the SF Bay Area after he graduates.
