        This was a busy week, since we didn't have class because of MLK day on Monday. That meant that the Monday classes were made up for on Wednesday, and I had two classes in a row in the same subjects. We usually have Mon/Thurs classes and Tue/Fri classes, but ended up having Wed/Thurs classes which didn't allow me too much time to do my KIEI 924 homework. But if you want to see what I've been up to in this awesome class, you can click the link below!
